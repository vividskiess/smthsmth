# Weapon Types Concept Idea

### Description

With the current weapons in UAC, they're all just Tiered DPS increases

Eg. Rifleman: 
- Tier 3: HK42, Daewoo K7, M5 MAR, Styner SPR
- Tier 2: US-MCR, Styner BR-2, 
- Tier 1: ATLAS-X50, SOF-AR, AK-47

Every tier (generally) is a direct DPS increase over the previous, there's nothing wrong with following this design philosophy, but there is a glaring drawback to this system.

Adding new weapons must either provide something really unique for it to be viable or power creep the existing weapons, is new X weapon more DPS than existing X weapon.

## Proposal

I've been getting inspiration from [Squad](https://squad.fandom.com/wiki/Weapons) weapon archetypes, and thought of some ways to adapt it to UAC.

Note this is just a rough concept, things can be changed/adapted/blah blah blah

What if weapons were classified into their own archetypes, with their strong points and weak points clearly defined, I know this already exists, rifleman has a DMR (BR-2), an SMG (Daewoo), ect. I'm thinking each archetype should clearly be defined.

With these new systems, we should think of new metrics/factors/traits that build on the current metrics like: +Damage, +Reload Speed, +Range, +Fire rate, +Unique Upgrade (Light filter, Grenade Launcher, ect).

### Attachment System Concept

To give the weapon archetypes a solid standing in the UAC ecosystem, we could introduce an attachment system, where depending on the weapon archetype, some weapons have either less/more access to equip attachments, Machine guns for example can have like 6/6 attachment slots available, whereas SMGs have 2/6 available, assault rifles 4/6

Weapons should have their own inventory space,, basically there will be a new UI, showing a depiction of the weapon and you can modify several points of the weapon with attachments, think of Escape from Tarkov's attachment system (obviously not this level of complexity).

The UI will be toggleable of course so you can show/hide the menu.

Instead of adding movement speed bonuses to the weapons themselves, why not just ship that off to attachments instead? We could introduce different "stocks" that weapons can equip to provide movement speed changes.

An entire new sub category of the item ecosystem could be expanded with the addition of many types of attachments (which sounds good on paper), also alot of metrics/stats/behaviors that can be modified depending on the attachment type, you could shift the Tier sytem into the attachment themselves, the better stocks give increased movement bonuses.

#### Accuracy Trait

This is just the surface for attachment systems but yeah, one thing that hasn't been touched imo is the "accuracy" in UAC, outside of targeted abilities, all weapons are guaranteed to hit enemies, what if we could introduce sights/scopes to weapons as an attachment type, that increases the accuracy of a weapon?

Note: this is more a glazing idea, implementing this into UAC might be a little tricky with how the effect chain functions in SC2
